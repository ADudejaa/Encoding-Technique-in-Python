Introduction: 

Differential Manchester Encoding (DM) is a line code in which data and clock signals are combinese.DM is a differential encoding, using the presence or absence of transitions to indicate logical value. It is not necessary to know the polarity of the sent signal since the information is nod to form a single 2-level self-synchronizing data streams in other words it does not matter which of the two voltage levels is received, but only whether it is the same or different from the previous one; this makes synchronization easier.
